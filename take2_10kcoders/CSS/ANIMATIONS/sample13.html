<!--Specify the fill-mode For an Animation
CSS animations do not affect an element before the first keyframe is played or after the last keyframe is played. The animation-fill-mode property can override this behavior.

The animation-fill-mode property specifies a style for the target element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both).

The animation-fill-mode property can have the following values:

none - Default value. Animation will not apply any styles to the element before or after it is executing
forwards - The element will retain the style values that is set by the last keyframe (depends on animation-direction and animation-iteration-count)
backwards - The element will get the style values that is set by the first keyframe (depends on animation-direction), and retain this during the animation-delay period
both - The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards, extending the animation properties in both directions
The following example lets the <div> element retain the style values from the last keyframe when the animation ends:-->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style> 
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;
  position: relative;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 3s;  
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}

@keyframes example {
  from {top: 0px;}
  to {top: 200px; background-color: blue;}
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>CSS Animation</h1>

<p>Let the div element retain the style values set by the last keyframe when the animation ends:</p>

<div></div>

</body>
