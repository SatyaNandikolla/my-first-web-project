<!--The @keyframes Rule
When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current 
style to the new style at certain times.

To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element.

The following example binds the "example" animation to the <div> element. The animation will last for 4 seconds, and it will gradually change the 
background-color of the <div> element from "red" to "yellow":-->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style> 
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
}

@keyframes example {
  from {background-color: red;}
  to {background-color: yellow;}
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>CSS Animation</h1>

<div></div>

<p><b>Note:</b> When an animation is finished, it goes back to its original style.</p>

</body>
</html>
